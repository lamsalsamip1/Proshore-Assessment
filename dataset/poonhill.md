Overview
Classic Poon Hill Round Trek
The Classic Poon Hill Ghorepani Round Trek is a five-day adventure starting from Kande, passing through the Australian Camp, and continuing to Ghorepani Poon Hill via Jhinu Hot Springs. This trek offers an unparalleled opportunity to explore traditional Gurung villages, such as Landruk and Chomrong, while enjoying breathtaking views of the Annapurna Himalayas and the rhododendron forests within the Inner Annapurna Conservation Area. Following an anti-clockwise route around the Australian Camp, the trek offers a refreshing escape from everyday life and an immersive experience in nature and village settings.

Pitam Deurali: A Scenic Stop
Before reaching Tolka, today’s campsite, trekkers will pass a small tea/lunch spot called Pitam Deurali (2,134 meters) at the top of a hill. This spot divides the trails for the Mardi Himal trek and the Classic Mardi Annapurna Base Camp Trek. Also known as Bhichok Deurali or just Deurali, Pitam Deurali is a ridge-top tea/lunch stop offering basic accommodation and beautiful views.

Relaxing at Jhinu Danda
On the Classic Poon Hill Ghorepani round trip, trekkers are in for a real treat at Jhinu Danda. The natural hot springs here provide a perfect place to relax while enjoying the view of the rushing river. The day’s second hike to Jhinu Danda (1,780 meters) involves a steep 30-minute descent through lush forests rich with flora and fauna, including spectacular rhododendrons. The hot spring pools, located along the banks of the powerful Modi Khola, are built into the riverbank, providing a therapeutic experience. Relax in the hot water, surrounded by beautiful trees, and listen to the sound of the river as you unwind.

Tadapani: A Key Stopover
On the third day, before reaching Ghorepani (2,874 meters), trekkers will spend the night in Tadapani. Named because the water source was once a considerable distance from the village, Tadapani is now a key meeting point for several trails. Trails from here lead to Chhomrong through Chuile and Gurzung, the Khopra Danda Khair Lake trek, and the Muldai View Trek.

Hiking to Ghorepani
The fourth day’s hike to Ghorepani features wide and well-maintained trails. The local hotels and lodges provide outstanding service, and trekkers can enjoy local dishes such as wild mushroom soup made from mushrooms collected by locals from the forest. On the fifth day, an early morning 30-minute hike up to Poon Hill (3,210 meters) offers one of Nepal’s most popular viewpoints. Most trekkers visit Poon Hill from Ghorepani at sunrise for spectacular views of Annapurna and Dhaulagiri. Despite the crowds during peak trekking seasons in spring and autumn, the views are well worth the effort. A coffee stand at the top serves both hot and cold beverages.

The Winter Experience
The Annapurna Classic Poon Hill Round Trek remains popular throughout the year, although the trail is quieter during winter. In winter, the Poon Hill trek offers clear views of the Annapurna Himalayan ranges, with more frequent clear skies making the scenery even more captivating. The Himalayan views reach their climax at the foothills of Classic Poon Hill, right at the beginning of the trek.

Fitness Level Required
The Classic Ghorepani Poon Hill trails are among the easiest in the Annapurna Region, especially compared to the Annapurna Base Camp Trek and the Everest Base Camp Trek. No specific training is required, but trekkers should be physically fit and capable of walking four to five hours per day. The Poon Hill trek is ideal for first-timers seeking an easy trail to explore the beauty of Annapurna.

Trekking Anti-Clockwise
While most trekkers on the Classic Poon Hill Trek start from Nayapul and hike clockwise, it is also possible to begin in an anticlockwise direction. Starting from Dhampus and hiking through Landruk, Tolka, and Ghandruk, before continuing to Tadapani, Ghorepani, and finally to Poon Hill, offers a unique perspective. This route, however, can be more challenging due to steeper ascents and longer walking hours in the initial days.

Combining with Annapurna Base Camp Trek
For those seeking a more extended adventure, the Classic Poon Hill Trek can be combined with the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC via Poon hill) Trek. This combination allows trekkers to experience both the scenic beauty of Poon Hill and the dramatic landscapes of the Annapurna Sanctuary. After reaching Ghorepani, continue to Tadapani and Chomrong before heading to ABC. The trek to ABC takes you through diverse landscapes, from lush forests to alpine meadows, and offers close-up views of towering peaks like Annapurna I and Machapuchare (Fishtail). This combined trek typically takes around 12-14 days, offering a comprehensive exploration of the Annapurna region.

Exploring the Mardi with Poon Hill
Another excellent option is to combine the Poon Hill Trek with the Mardi Himal Trek. The Mardi Himal Trek is a hidden gem that takes trekkers off the beaten path to the base of Mardi Himal and the Mardi Himal Base Camp. After enjoying the sunrise at Poon Hill, continue your journey towards Landruk and Forest Camp. From here, the trail ascends through rhododendron forests and ridges, providing stunning views of the Mardi Himal, Machapuchare, and the Annapurna range. This trek offers a more solitary experience, away from the crowds, and is ideal for those looking for a peaceful adventure. Combining Poon Hill and Mardi Himal typically takes around 10-12 days.

The Annapurna Circuit Trek
For an even more ambitious adventure, consider the Annapurna Circuit Trek. This trek encompasses the Classic Poon Hill Trek and much more, taking trekkers on a circular journey around the Annapurna Massif. From the lower elevations, the trail ascends slowly, passing through diverse landscapes and cultural settings. The Annapurna Circuit Trek includes the challenging Thorong La Pass (5,416 meters), one of the highest trekking passes in the world. This trek offers unparalleled views of Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and other peaks. The Annapurna Circuit Trek can be combined with a visit to Poon Hill by starting or ending your trek at Ghorepani. This extended trek typically takes around 18-21 days.

Highlights of the Combined Treks
Cultural Exploration
Combining these treks provides a deeper cultural experience. Trekkers will pass through various ethnic villages, including those of the Gurung, Thakali, and Magar communities. It also offers a glimpse into the unique traditions, architecture, and local hospitality. Participating in local festivals, trying traditional foods, and visiting monasteries and temples enhance the cultural richness of the trek.

Natural Beauty
The combined treks showcase the diverse natural beauty of the Annapurna region. From the lush green forests and terraced fields of the lower elevations to the alpine meadows and glacial moraines of the higher altitudes, trekkers will feel a changing landscape. The rhododendron forests, in particular, are a highlight during the spring seasons, when they are in full bloom, adding vibrant colors to the scenery.

Panoramic Views
One of the main attractions of these treks is the panoramic views of the Himalayas, Poon Hill offers a stunning sunrise view of Annapurna and Dhaulagiri, while the Mardi Himal Trek provides close-up views of Mardi Himal and Machapuchare. The Annapurna Base Camp and Annapurna Circuit treks offer dramatic vistas of towering peaks, including Annapurna I, Gangapurna, and Tilicho Peak. The combination of these views creates a memorable trekking experience.

Varied Terrain
The treks offer varied terrain, from gentle trails through forests and villages to challenging ascents and high passes. This variety keeps the trek interesting and provides different physical challenges. Whether it’s the steep climb to Poon Hill, the forested trails of Mardi Himal, or the high-altitude Thorong La Pass, each segment of the trek offers a unique experience.

Wildlife Encounters
The Annapurna region has diverse wildlife, including Himalayan tahr, langur monkeys, and various bird species. Trekkers may also encounter rare species such as the red panda and the elusive snow leopard in higher altitudes. The conservation areas and national parks regions play a crucial role in preserving te shespecies and their habitats.
